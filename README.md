# CV&DL Project by Christian Le and Aleksander Klund

Chosen project: Object detection with LiDAR Data from Trondheim

## Project Rules

1. The code should be developed by yourself, but you are free to use open-source repositories and libraries. If you take code from anywhere else, please attribute the original authors in your source code and write a notice in your report. 
2. You are allowed to use open-source architectures from PyTorch or MONAI etc. 
3. Annotating the test data by yourself and using it to train/validate your model is NOT allowed. 
4. It is allowed to use any pre-trained model. However, you cannot use models pre-trained on any of the respective datasets for each track. 
5. Training your final model should not take more than 12 hours on the IDUN cluster using 1 GPU or on the computers at the Cybele lab.

## Path to data

* IDUN: ~/../../cluster/projects/vc/data/ad/open/NAPLab-LiDAR
